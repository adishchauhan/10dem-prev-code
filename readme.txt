// this is for you, developer:

For now, none of the routes will work, just create .env 
file and add clientId and clientSecret from respective
OAuth suppliers (google,fb,linkedin)

It will work smoothly. And use passport-local for username/password authentication

the authentication and authorization process will be done.

(Make changes to routes accordingly)
